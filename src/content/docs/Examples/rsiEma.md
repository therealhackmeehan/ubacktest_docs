title: RSI with Exponential Moving Average Confirmation
---

---

### Explanation & Rationale  

The **RSI with Exponential Moving Average (EMA) Confirmation** strategy builds upon the classic **Relative Strength Index (RSI)** by incorporating an **Exponential Moving Average (EMA)** to smooth the RSI calculation. The smoothing effect of the EMA helps to reduce the noise and make the RSI more responsive to recent price movements, which can enhance the timing of trade signals.  

### Code

```python
'''
Buy Low, Sell High (Smoothed RSI).

Sell stock when the Relative Strength Index (RSI) crosses above 70.
Buy stock when the RSI crosses below 30.
Uses an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) for smoothing RSI calculation.

import pandas as pd

def calculate_rsi_ema(series, window=14):
    delta = series.diff()

    gain = delta.where(delta > 0, 0)
    loss = -delta.where(delta < 0, 0)

    avg_gain = gain.ewm(span=window, adjust=False).mean()
    avg_loss = loss.ewm(span=window, adjust=False).mean()

    rs = avg_gain / avg_loss
    rsi = 100 - (100 / (1 + rs))

    return rsi

def strategy(data):
    data['RSI'] = calculate_rsi_ema(data['close'], window=14)

    # Generate signals
    data['signal'] = data['RSI'].apply(lambda x: 1 if x > 70 else -1 if x < 30 else 0)

    return data
