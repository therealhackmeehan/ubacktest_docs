title: RSI with Moving Average Confirmation
---

```python
'''
Buy Low, Sell High with Trend Confirmation.

Sell stock when RSI crosses above 70 **and** the stock is below its 50-day SMA.
Buy stock when RSI crosses below 30 **and** the stock is above its 50-day SMA.
This helps reduce false signals in volatile markets.

    avg_gain = gain.rolling(window=window, min_periods=1).mean()
    avg_loss = loss.rolling(window=window, min_periods=1).mean()

    rs = avg_gain / avg_loss
    rsi = 100 - (100 / (1 + rs))
