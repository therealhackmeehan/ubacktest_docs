title: Stochastic Oscillator Strategy
---

### Explanation & Rationale  

The Stochastic Oscillator Strategy identifies potential momentum reversals by measuring the relative position of a stock’s closing price within its recent high-low range. A buy signal occurs when the %K line crosses above the %D line in the oversold zone (below 20), suggesting a potential upward reversal, while a short signal is triggered when %K crosses below %D in the overbought zone (above 80), indicating a possible downward reversal. This strategy helps traders capitalize on short-term shifts in market momentum by filtering out extreme price conditions.

### Code

```python
'''
Stochastic Oscillator Strategy.

Buy when the %K line crosses above the %D line below 20 (oversold condition).
Short when the %K line crosses below the %D line above 80 (overbought condition).
This strategy helps capture momentum reversals.
