title: Ichimoku Cloud Strategy
---

### Explanation & Rationale  

The Ichimoku Cloud Strategy provides a comprehensive view of trend direction, momentum, and support/resistance levels by combining multiple moving average-based components. A buy signal occurs when the Conversion Line crosses above the Base Line while the price remains above the cloud, indicating strong bullish momentum, while a short signal is triggered when the Conversion Line crosses below the Base Line with the price below the cloud, confirming a downtrend. This strategy helps traders filter out noise and trade in the direction of established trends with higher probability.

### Code

```python
'''
Ichimoku Cloud Strategy.

Buy when the Conversion Line crosses above the Base Line and the price is above the cloud.
Short when the Conversion Line crosses below the Base Line and the price is below the cloud.
The Ichimoku Cloud provides insights into trend direction and momentum.
