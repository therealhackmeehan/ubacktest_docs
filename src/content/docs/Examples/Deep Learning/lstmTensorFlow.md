title: LSTM (TensorFlow)

### Explanation & Rationale

The LSTM Strategy leverages the power of deep learning to identify subtle patterns in historical price data that may signal future movements. By analyzing sequences of past stock prices—including open, high, low, and close—it predicts the next day’s closing price and issues a signal based on the expected direction. A buy signal is generated when the model forecasts an upward move, and a short signal when a decline is anticipated. This approach assumes that recent price behavior contains valuable information about short-term trends, enabling data-driven predictions beyond traditional technical indicators.

### Code

```python
'''
Long Short Term Memory in TensorFlow

A simple LSTM model that takes normalized stock price data ("open", "high", "low", "close")
and learns to predict the next day's close price. It adds a "signal" column to the data,
where 1 means the predicted price will go up, and -1 means it will go down.
