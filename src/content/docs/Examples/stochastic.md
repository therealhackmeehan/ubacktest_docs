title: Stochastic Oscillator Strategy
---

### Explanation & Rationale

The **Stochastic Oscillator Strategy** is designed to identify overbought and oversold conditions in the market, helping traders capture potential momentum reversals. It uses the **%K** and **%D** lines of the stochastic oscillator, a momentum indicator, to generate buy and sell signals based on specific conditions.

### Code

```python
'''
Stochastic Oscillator Strategy.

Buy when the %K line crosses above the %D line below 20 (oversold condition).
Sell when the %K line crosses below the %D line above 80 (overbought condition).
This strategy helps capture momentum reversals.

    high_max = data['high'].rolling(window=window).max()
    stoch_k = 100 * (data['close'] - low_min) / (high_max - low_min)
    stoch_d = stoch_k.rolling(window=3).mean()  # 3-day moving average of %K
    return stoch_k, stoch_d

    data.loc[(data['%K'] < 20) & (data['%K'] > data['%D']), 'signal'] = 1  # Buy signal
    data.loc[(data['%K'] > 80) & (data['%K'] < data['%D']), 'signal'] = -1  # Sell signal
