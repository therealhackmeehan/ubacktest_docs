title: Average True Range Strategy
---

### Explanation & Rationale  

The **Average True Range (ATR) Breakout Strategy** is a volatility-based trading approach that identifies breakout opportunities using ATR as a dynamic threshold. Unlike fixed-price breakouts, this strategy adapts to market conditions, allowing for more flexible entry and exit points.  

### Code

```python
'''
ATR Breakout Strategy.

Buy when the price breaks above the previous high + ATR * multiplier.
Sell when the price breaks below the previous low - ATR * multiplier.
This strategy captures volatility breakouts with dynamic stop-loss levels.

import pandas as pd

def calculate_atr(data, window=14):
    high_low = data['high'] - data['low']
    high_close = (data['high'] - data['close'].shift()).abs()
    low_close = (data['low'] - data['close'].shift()).abs()
    tr = pd.concat([high_low, high_close, low_close], axis=1)
    atr = tr.max(axis=1).rolling(window=window).mean()
    return atr

def strategy(data, atr_multiplier=2):
    data['ATR'] = calculate_atr(data)

    # Generate breakout signals based on ATR
    data['signal'] = 0
    data.loc[data['close'] > (data['high'].shift() + data['ATR'] * atr_multiplier), 'signal'] = 1  # Buy signal
    data.loc[data['close'] < (data['low'].shift() - data['ATR'] * atr_multiplier), 'signal'] = -1  # Sell signal

    return data
