title: Exponential Regression
---

### Explanation & Rationale  

The Exponential Regression Strategy fits a regression model to the past 14 days of log-transformed prices, capturing exponential trends in market movements. By predicting the next day’s price and comparing it to the most recent closing price, the strategy generates buy signals for expected uptrends and sell signals for anticipated downtrends. This approach helps identify non-linear price trends more effectively than linear models, making it useful for markets that exhibit compounding growth or decay.

### Code

```python
'''
Exponential Regression Strategy.

Trains an Exponential Regression model using the past 14 days of data to predict the next day's price movement (up/down).
