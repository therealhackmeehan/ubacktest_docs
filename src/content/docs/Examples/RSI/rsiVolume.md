title: RSI with Volume Confirmation
---

### Explanation & Rationale  

The Buy Low, Sell/Short High with Volume Confirmation strategy enhances the RSI-based signals by requiring volume confirmation to ensure that there is strong momentum behind the price movement. A buy signal is generated when the RSI crosses below 30 and volume exceeds its 50-day average, indicating an oversold condition with increased market participation. Similarly, a short signal occurs when the RSI crosses above 70 and volume is above its 50-day average, confirming strong selling pressure, which helps to capture more reliable momentum-driven moves.

### How to Make It Your Own

### Code

```python
'''
Buy Low, Sell//Short High with Volume Confirmation.

Short stock when RSI crosses above 70 **and** volume is above its 50-day average.
Buy stock when RSI crosses below 30 **and** volume is above its 50-day average.
This ensures strong momentum behind the signals.
