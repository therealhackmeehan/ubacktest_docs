### Simulate Live Market Conditions

At **uBacktest**, our goal is to help you build and refine your trading strategies before putting real money on the line. A strategy may look great on paper, but live market conditions introduce new challenges and risks.  

### Beta Deployment: Trade, But Safely

Our **beta framework** lets you deploy your Python-based strategy in real-time market conditions—using **paper trading** to simulate actual trades without financial risk.  

### Paper vs. Live Trading

Our system is designed for **fake/paper money**, allowing you to test your strategy in real market conditions without the risk of losing capital.  

### Proceed with Caution... Stick to Paper!

As described in our Terms of Service, if you connect your deployed script to Alpaca’s live trading API, you **assume full responsibility** for any incurred losses.

We are not responsible for any financial risks arising from live trading. This tool is intended solely for strategy testing with paper money and simulation purposes. Accuracy and repeatability in live markets are not guaranteed.

Even minor coding mistakes or logical errors can result in significant losses.
