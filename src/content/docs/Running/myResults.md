### Happy With Your Result?

Congratulations on running a successful backtest! 

Don't forget to **name** and **save** your result for future use. It will appear on your results page:

### What Can I Do with a Saved Result?

#### 1. Analyze

If you have multiple results (at least two) from the same strategy, select the __Group by Parent Strategy__ option. This lets you compare overall statistics across the strategy and visually see which date ranges have been tested. Aim for a well-balanced spread of date ranges when testing your strategy!

#### 2. Share

You can share your strategy with other users if they have an account with us! Once shared, your strategy will appear in their __Shared with Me__ section on the results page. They’ll need to accept the strategy before being able to view it.

#### 3. Lock/Unlock

Control whether your strategy appears on the global leaderboard. Don't worry, even public strategies won’t expose your code or inner workings!

#### 4. Rename

Rename your strategy. If you’ve shared it, the new name will reflect for all users.

#### 5. Delete

You can delete your result at any time.

:::caution
If you’ve shared the strategy, deleting it will also remove it from the accounts of anyone you’ve shared it with.
